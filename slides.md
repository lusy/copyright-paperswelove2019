# Chapter 10: Intellectual Property

---

## In a nutshell

> "We are not entering a time when copyright
> is more threatened than it is in real space. We are instead entering a time
> when copyright is more effectively protected than at any time since Gutenberg."

---

"As Jessica Litman
described more than a decade ago,
At the turn of the century, U.S. copyright law was technical, inconsistent, and
difficult to understand, but it didn’t apply to very many people or very many
things. If one were an author or publisher of books, maps, charts, paintings,
sculpture, photographs or sheet music, a playwright or producer of plays, or a
printer, the copyright law bore on one’s business. Booksellers, [...]
musicians, scholars, [...], and ordinary consumers could go about their business
without ever encountering a copyright problem."

---

"the single, defining feature of these norms can perhaps be summarized like
this: that a consumer could do with the copyrighted content that he legally
owned anything he wanted to do, without ever triggering the law of copyright."

---

"Roughly put, copyright gives a copyright holder certain exclusive rights over
the work, including, most famously, the exclusive right to copy the work."

"The right is protected to the extent that laws (and norms) support it,"
"it is threatened to the extent that technology makes it easy to copy."
"In this sense, copyright has always been at war with technology."

---

## Analog vs digital

"Thus there were many ways in which you could use creative work in the
analog world without producing a copy."

"Digital technology, at its core, makes copies."

"There is no way to use any content in a digital
context without that use producing a copy."

---

## Possible regulators

"What means would bring
about the most efficient set of protections for property interests in cyberspace?"

"One is the traditional protection of
law—the law defines a space where others should not enter and punishes
people who enter nonetheless. The other protection is a fence, a technological
device (a bit of code) that (among other things) blocks the unwanted from
entering."

---

"it is hard for the law to distinguish between legitimate and illegiti-
mate uses of cyberspaces"

---

## White Paper 1995

"The White Paper proceeds as if the problem of pro-
tecting intellectual property in cyberspace was just like the problem of
protecting intellectual property in real space.
[...]
But something fundamental has changed: the role that code plays in the
protection of intellectual property. Code can, and increasingly will, displace
law as the primary defense of intellectual property in cyberspace. Private
fences, not public law."

---

## DMCA 1998

"Code that some-
one implements to control either access to or use of a copyrighted work got
special legal protection under the DMCA: Circumvention of that code, subject
to a few important exceptions, constituted a violation of the law."

---

## Law vs contracts vs code

"As Stefik writes:
[T]he consumer does not have the option of
disregarding a digital contract by, for example, making unauthorized copies of
a work."

---

## trusted systems

"What copyright seeks to do using the threat of law and the push of norms,
trusted systems do through the code."

---

## For whom is the law

"If the law did not
protect authorship at all, there would be fewer authors."

---

"Private law creates private rights to the extent that these private rights
serve some collective good. If a private right is harmful to a collective good,
then the state has no reason to create it."

---

"An important point about copyright law is that, though designed in part
to protect authors, the control it was designed to create was never to be per-
fect."

"the law was never designed to simply do the author’s bidding. It had pub-
lic purposes as well as the author’s interest in mind."

---

"Now if all you think about is protecting the distribution of professionally
created culture, this might not concern you much. If you’re trying to stop
“piracy,” then a regime that says every use requires permission is a regime
that gives you a fairly broad range of tools for stamping out piracy."

---

"Standing alongside professional culture is amateur culture—where ama-
teur doesn’t mean inferior or without talent, but instead culture created by
people who produce not for the money, but for the love of what they do."

"Importantly, too, this kind of cultural remix has historically been free of
regulation."

---

"digital technologies have radically expanded the scope of
this amateur culture. Now the clever remix of some political event or the
latest song by your favorite band are not just something you can share with
your friends. Digital technologies have made it simple to capture and share
this creativity with the world."

---

"while there is extensive and new
regulation of amateur culture, that regulation creates new wealth for profes-
sional culture. There’s a choice to be made about which form of culture we
should protect."

---

## Fair use

"Were these transactions left free because it
was too costly to meter them? Or were these transactions left free because
keeping them free was an important public value tied to copyright?"

---

"So copyright law strikes a balance between control and access."

"The point should be obvious: When intellectual property is protected by
code, nothing requires that the same balance be struck. Nothing requires the
owner to grant the right of fair use."

---

"But maybe this conflict is just temporary. Couldn’t the code be changed
to protect fair use?
The answer to that hopeful (and again, hopeful because my main point is
about whether incentives to protect fair use exist) question is no, not directly.
Fair use inherently requires a judgment about purpose, or intent. That judg-
ment is beyond the ken of even the best computers."

---

## right to read anonymously

"we must ask whether the latent right
to read anonymously, given to us before by imperfections in technologies,
should be a legally protected right."

---

"These three examples reveal a common pattern—one that will reach far
beyond copyright. At one time we enjoyed a certain kind of liberty. But that
liberty was not directly chosen; it was a liberty resulting from the high costs of
control."

---

## Pending Choices

- whether to allow intellectual property in effect to
become completely propertized
- whether to allow this regime to
erase the anonymity latent in less efficient architectures of control
- whether
to allow the expansion of intellectual property to drive out amateur culture
