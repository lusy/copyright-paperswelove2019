Draft Article 11 (Article 15) "link tax" "Google should pay for content they use and generate profit out of" (didn't work in Spain)

## In a nutshell

> Cyberspace/the Internet changes not only the possibilities for content duplication and sharing but also the possibilities for control.
> Balance is displaced; fair use (previously tolerated because prosecution was unfeasible?) is threatened

> "What means would bring
> about the most efficient set of protections for property interests in cyberspace?" (p.169)
> "One is the traditional protection of
> law—the law defines a space where others should not enter and punishes
> people who enter nonetheless. The other protection is a fence, a technological
> device (a bit of code) that (among other things) blocks the unwanted from
> entering."
> "Both cost money, and the return
> from each is not necessarily the same. From a social perspective, we would
> want the mix that provides optimal protection at the lowest cost."

Notes:
"costs of law in this context are
extremely high"
"costs of enforcement, but also
because it is hard for the law to distinguish between legitimate and illegiti-
mate uses of cyberspaces."
"Legitimacy depends on the intention of the person granting
access."
"since the fences of cyberspace can be made to reflect that intent
cheaply, it is best to put all the incentive on the owner to define access as he
wishes. The right to browse should be the norm, and the burden to lock doors
should be placed on the owner. 4"

> "They also invite a question
> that has been asked by Justice Stephen Breyer and many others: Should law
> protect some kinds of property—in particular, intellectual property—at all?"

---

> "Roughly put, copyright gives a copyright holder certain exclusive rights over
> the work, including, most famously, the exclusive right to copy the work."
> "The right is protected to the extent that laws (and norms) support it,"
> "it is threatened to the extent that technology makes it easy to copy." (p.172)
> "In this sense, copyright has always been at war with technology."
> "as the cost of copying decreased, and the spread of technologies for
> copying increased, the threat to the author’s control increased."

---

> "the single, defining feature of these norms can perhaps be summarized like
> this: that a consumer could do with the copyrighted content that he legally
> owned anything he wanted to do, without ever triggering the law of copyright."
> "This norm was true almost by definition until 1909, since before then, the law
> didn’t regulate “copies.” Any use the consumer made of copyrighted content
> was therefore highly unlikely to trigger any of the exclusive rights of copyright.
> After 1909, though the law technically regulated “copies,” the technologies to
> make copies were broadly available."

> "Among the kinds of property law might protect, my focus in this chapter
> will be on the property protected by copyright. 6 Of all the different types of
> property, this type is said to be the most vulnerable to the changes that cyber-
> space will bring. Many believe that intellectual property cannot be protected
> in cyberspace."

DMCA:
"Congress followed the recommendations of the 1995 White Paper in some
respects. The most important was the enactment of the Digital Millennium
Copyright Act in 1998. That statute implemented directly the recommendation
that “technological protection measures” be protected by law. Code that some-
one implements to control either access to or use of a copyrighted work got
special legal protection under the DMCA: Circumvention of that code, subject
to a few important exceptions, constituted a violation of the law."

---

"The White Paper proceeds as if the problem of pro-
tecting intellectual property in cyberspace was just like the problem of
protecting intellectual property in real space.
[...]
But something fundamental has changed: the role that code plays in the
protection of intellectual property. Code can, and increasingly will, displace
law as the primary defense of intellectual property in cyberspace. Private
fences, not public law." (p.175)

---

"In such an age, the real question for law is not, how can law aid in that
protection? but rather, is the protection too great?"
//*cough*, EU Directive
