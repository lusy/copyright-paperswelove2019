Code is law.

There's law we can ignore according to our best judgement. (e.g. fair use)
And there's law we can't (e.g. upload filters implemented in software. even if the contents they filter out are unrightfully filtered out)

# Who's Lessig

born 1961
US-American law professor, attorney and political activist

free culture, remix culture, net neutrality; fight against corruption

- Roy L. Furman Professor of Law at Harvard Law School
- previously Stanford Law School (founded Center for Internet and Society) and University of Chicago
- former board member of FSF
- founded Creative Commons in 2001

Fun Facts
- was a candidate of the Democratic Party for the 2016 presidential elections, but stepped down before the primaries
- ". As co-director of the Center for the Study of Constitutionalism in Eastern Europe there, he helped the newly-independent Republic of Georgia draft a constitution" (EN WP)
"Lessig has emphasized in interviews that his philosophy experience at Cambridge radically changed his values and career path. Previously, he had held strong conservative or libertarian political views, desired a career in business, was a highly active member of Teenage Republicans, served as the Youth Governor for Pennsylvania through the YMCA Youth and Government program[23] in 1978, and almost pursued a Republican political career. "
("Lessig earned a B.A. degree in economics and a B.S. degree in management (Wharton School) from the University of Pennsylvania, an M.A. degree in philosophy from the University of Cambridge (Trinity) in England, and a J.D. degree from Yale Law School in 1989.")
and clerked for 2 conservative judges
"Lessig remains skeptical of government intervention but favors some regulation, calling himself "a constitutionalist.""

# Context, v1, v2

1999 Code and other Laws of Cyberspace
2006 Code Version 2.0

v2 is a update; based on a wiki maintained and evaluated by Lessig and a group of Stanford Law School students
enforces Lessig's viewpoint that cyberspace is indeed regulable and government's control will only increase (which we are being witnesses of)

v2 starts with "This is a translation of an old book–indeed, in Internet time, it is a translation of an ancient text."

"Governments couldn't touch life online. And hence, life online would be different, and separate, from the dynamic of life offline. Code v1 was an argument against that then common view.
In the years since, that common view has faded. The confidence of the Internet exceptionalists has waned. The idea–and even the desire–that the Internet would remain unregulated is gone."

# EU Copyright Directive

a copyright reform --> a good thing, it is hopelessly outdated

it was voted in favour on 26 March 2019

"The European Council (EC) describes their key goals with the Directive as protecting press publications; reducing the "value gap" between the profits made by Internet platforms and by content creators; encouraging collaboration between these two groups, and creating copyright exceptions for text- and data-mining.[3]" EN WP

Timeline
       2012 The Commission announces they will be revising the 2001 Copyright Directive
   Jul 2014 EC publishes first report on the state of EU copyright
14 Sep 2016 EC issues first draft of the directive
20 Jun 2018 Directive is introduced by the European Parliament Committee on Legal Affairs
12 Sep 2018 the Parliament approves a revised proposal
13 Feb 2019 The final version, which resulted from negotiations during formal trilogue meetings, is presented to the parliament
26 Mar 2019 Parlament votes in favour

"Nach einer Protestkampagne, die in den letzten Wochen immer mehr an Fahrt aufnahm und am vergangenen Wochenende mit Protesten von fast 200.000 Menschen ihren Höhepunkt fand, kam gestern mit der Abstimmung im Europaparlament die Ernüchterung: Das Parlament nahm die EU-Urheberrechtsreform an."

"Die linke EU-Abgeordnete Martina Michels kommentierte:

    Naive Technikgläubigkeit und härtester Lobbyismus von Springer & Co. haben dazu geführt, dass wir jetzt mit einer Richtlinie konfrontiert sind, die die Meinungsfreiheit bedroht, die Medienpluralität einschränkt und den meisten Kreativen keinen Cent mehr bringen wird."

"In eine ähnliche Richtung kommentierte Diego Naranjo vom Dachverband digitaler Bürgerrechtsorganisatioen EDRi:

    Enttäuschenderweise hilft die neu angenommene Richtlinie nicht kleinen unabhängigen Urhebern, sondern stärkt Technologiegiganten. Noch alarmierender ist, dass Artikel 13 der Richtlinie einen gefährlichen Präzedenzfall für Internetfilter und automatisierte Zensurmechanismen schafft – in der EU und weltweit."

"Tabea Rößner, Netzpolitische Sprecherin der Grünen im Bundestag, sagt:

    Die EU-Richtlinie schafft allerdings hauptsächlich Rechtsunsicherheit zulasten kleiner Plattformen, über denen künftig das Haftungsrisiko schwebt. Plattformen werden eher rigoros löschen, bevor sie das Risiko eines Gerichtsprozesses auf sich nehmen. Für die großen Plattformen, auf die die Regelung abzielt, ist das aufgrund ihrer Marktmacht kein Problem. Im Gegenteil, für sie wird sogar noch ein neues Geschäftsmodell mit ihren bereits entwickelten Filtertechnologien geschaffen. Diese sind allerdings sehr fehleranfällig und können beispielsweise Satire oder Zitate nicht von einer Urheberrechtsverletzung unterscheiden."

"In Deutschland haben in den vergangenen Wochen 300.000 Menschen gegen die Klimapolitik und fast 200.000 gegen die Netzpolitik der Bundesregierung demonstriert. Die Jugend entdeckt die Straße, die selbst gemalten Schilder und den Protest. Und das ist ein gutes, ein hoffnungsvolles Zeichen für die Zukunft. "

"Am Ende war es das zu langsame Überschwappen der Proteste in andere Länder, ein paar Tausend Leute in Paris oder Rom die fehlten, um die Reform zu kippen."

"Die Konservativen im Parlament wollten sogar die Abstimmung vorziehen, weil sie bemerkten, dass die Proteste mit jedem Tag stärker wurden. Die Kommission beschimpfte den Protest als Mob, Politiker verunglimpften die Demonstranten als Bots, das Parlament spielte Werbevideos für die Reform auf Twitter ab und der CDU-Mann Caspary griff gar in die Diktatoren-Argumentekiste – und bezeichnete die Demonstrierenden als gekauft."

"Dabei sollten wir uns eigentlich freuen: Wir sind Urheber, wir sind Verleger und laut den Verbänden, die uns vertreten, sollten jetzt goldene Zeiten für uns anbrechen. Das Geld von Google und Co. wird nur so zu uns fließen! Allerdings bezweifle ich, dass uns diese Reform mehr Geld einbringen wird. Und selbst wenn, die Kollateralschäden für eine demokratische Netzöffentlichkeit sind viel größer als den Befürwortern dieser Reform mit ihrem Tunnelblick auf wirtschaftliche Eigeninteressen bewusst sein dürfte."

"Alte und reformunfähige Verwertungsgesellschaften verfügen weiterhin über die Deutungshoheit, obwohl weite Teile der neuen Urheber in diesen aus vielen Gründen keine Heimat finden werden. Kein Wunder, dass hier massive Konflikte entstehen, zwischen neuen und alten Verwertungsformen, zwischen denen, die das Internet in ihre Verwertungsstrategie eingebunden haben und denjenigen, die hoffen, dass die alte Welt weiter läuft wie bisher."

" Beim Leistungsschutzrecht für Presseverleger hieß es lange Zeit, die Einnahmen würden zwischen Verlegern und Urhebern geteilt. Beim letzten Kompromiss sind die Ansprüche der Urheber dann „zufällig“ zugunsten der Verleger und Medienkonzerne rausgeflogen."

"Hier hat sich die alte Medienwelt nach einem 15 Jahre währenden Kreuzzug gegen Youtube nochmal durchgesetzt. Der Kollateralschaden ist, dass sie damit ihre alte Welt mit ihren alten Werkzeugen für weitere 20 Jahre in Stein gemeißelt haben – ohne Antworten für eine sich entwickelnde neue Welt mit neuen Produzenten zu geben."

"Mit der Schrotflinte auf Youtube geschossen, halbes Netz mitgetroffen"

"Das Problem von Anfang an bei dieser Reform: Man schießt mit der Schrotflinte auf die großen Plattformen, die Uploadfilter-Systeme schon mehr und weniger schlecht einsetzen und trifft so vor allem zahlreiche kleine Plattformen, die bislang ohne Filter-Systeme ausgekommen sind.  "
"Sie müssen künftig ebenfalls filtern, auf Uploads ihrer Nutzer verzichten oder den Dienst ganz einstellen."

"Wir sind gespannt, wann Verlagsjustiziare feststellen, dass ihre Angebote mit Nutzerinhalten auch unter diese Definition fallen, sie dafür haften könnten und auch Uploadfilter installieren müssen."

"Wir sind mittlerweile alle Urheber. Diese Reform geht aber immer noch davon aus, dass es nur wenige professionelle Urheber gibt, für die es einen Rechtsrahmen braucht. Das ist nur aus einer Perspektive zu schaffen, die das Internet noch eher aus der Zeitung kennt."

"Diese Reform hat keine Antwort darauf gefunden, dass private Nutzer bei nicht-kommerziellen Alltagshandlungen Abmahnungen riskieren, wenn sie etwa Memes auf ihrer Webseite veröffentlichen "

"Diese Reform hat keine Antwort darauf, dass legitime Nutzungsformen ständig mit einem Bein in einer Urheberrechtsverletzung stehen. Da reicht es auch nicht, wenn im Text steht, dass die Upload-Filter bitte lieb zu Memes sein sollten. Das ist kein Rechtsanspruch wie ein Recht auf Remix im Rahmen einer Schrankenregelung, die man hätte einbauen können."

"Profitieren werden die Großen, seien es die Plattformen oder Medienkonzerne. Darunter leiden werden die Kleinen"
"Urheber müssen mehr mit Verwertern teilen, ihre Stellung wird aber nicht wirklich verbessert. "
"Neue Ausnahmen für Fair Use, für Remix oder für Bagatellnutzungen wird es weiterhin nicht geben."

Upload filters should be useful not only to enforce copyright, but apparently in the war on terror -.-
internet pionerees sign an open letter against the idea

"Uploadfilter und kurze Löschfristen

Der im Herbst vorgestellte Entwurf der EU-Kommission zielt darauf ab, mutmaßlich terroristische Inhalte aus dem Netz zu entfernen. Dies soll die Radikalisierung von Nutzern eindämmen und in einem weiteren Schritt dazu führen, dass weniger Terroranschläge verübt werden, führte jüngst die Justizkommissarin Věra Jourová gegenüber netzpolitik.org aus.

Umsetzen will die Kommission das mit einer engmaschigen Zensurinfrastruktur, die für alle in Europa tätigen Online-Dienste gelten soll. Innerhalb von nur einer Stunde müssten sie auf einen Hinweis von Behörden reagieren und mutmaßlich terroristische Inhalte auf ihren Plattformen sperren oder löschen.

Zudem sieht der Entwurf „proaktive Maßnahmen“ vor, also Uploadfilter, mit denen die Anbieter solche Inhalte direkt nach dem Hochladen erkennen, einschätzen und gegebenenfalls entfernen sollen. Im Falle von Verstößen kann der Einsatz von Uploadfiltern angeordnet werden, hohe Geldstrafen sollen für Abschreckung sorgen."

"Ein ungenaue Definition von „terroristischen Inhalten“ würde durch ihre „extreme Bandbreite“ dazu führen, dass im Zweifel zu viel als zu wenig gelöscht würde, auch journalistische oder wissenschaftliche Inhalte. "

"Die kaum umsetzbare Löschfrist würde zudem insbesondere kleinere Anbieter hart treffen und neben befürchteten „Overblocking“-Effekten auch „große multinationale Plattformen“ stärken"

" Darüber hinaus riskiere der Einsatz der bis auf Weiteres mangelhaften Technologie das Unterdrücken wichtiger Nachrichten, etwa Zeitungsartikel oder Berichterstattung aus Kriegsgebieten."

=============================================================================
Lessig Code 2.0

Chapter 10

Cyberspace/the Internet changes not only the possibilities for content duplication and sharing but also the possibilities for control.
Balance is displaced; fair use (previously tolerated because prosecution was unfeasible?) is threatened

"What means would bring
about the most efficient set of protections for property interests in cyberspace?" (p.169)
"One is the traditional protection of
law—the law defines a space where others should not enter and punishes
people who enter nonetheless. The other protection is a fence, a technological
device (a bit of code) that (among other things) blocks the unwanted from
entering."
"Both cost money, and the return
from each is not necessarily the same. From a social perspective, we would
want the mix that provides optimal protection at the lowest cost."

"The implication of this idea in real space is that it sometimes makes sense
to shift the burden of protection to citizens rather than to the state."(p.170)
"Reeves’s insight about cyberspace follows the same line. The optimal
protection for spaces in cyberspace is a mix between public law and private
fences."
"costs of law in this context are
extremely high"
"costs of enforcement, but also
because it is hard for the law to distinguish between legitimate and illegiti-
mate uses of cyberspaces."
"Legitimacy depends on the intention of the person granting
access."
"since the fences of cyberspace can be made to reflect that intent
cheaply, it is best to put all the incentive on the owner to define access as he
wishes. The right to browse should be the norm, and the burden to lock doors
should be placed on the owner. 4"

"• I have a stack of firewood behind my house. No one steals it. If I left my bike out
overnight, it would be gone.
• A friend told me that, in a favorite beach town, the city used to find it impossible
to plant flowers—they would immediately be picked. But now, he proudly
reports, after a long “community spirit” campaign, the flowers are no longer
picked.
• There are special laws about the theft of automobiles, planes, and boats. There
are no special laws about the theft of skyscrapers. Cars, planes, and boats need
protection. Skyscrapers pretty much take care of themselves."

"Many things protect property against theft—differently. The market pro-
tects my firewood (it is cheaper to buy your own than it is to haul mine away);
the market is a special threat to my bike (which if taken is easily sold). Norms
sometimes protect flowers in a park; sometimes they do not. Nature some-
times conspires with thieves (cars, planes, and boats) and sometimes against
them (skyscrapers).
These protections are not fixed. I could lock my bike and thereby use
real-space code to make it harder to steal. There could be a shortage of fire-
wood; demand would increase, making it harder to protect. Public campaigns
about civic beauty might stop flower theft; selecting a distinctive flower might
do the same. Sophisticated locks might make stolen cars useless; sophisticated
bank fraud might make skyscrapers vulnerable. The point is not that protec-
tions are given, or unchangeable, but that they are multiplied and their
modalities different."(p.171)

"From the point of view of the state, we need law
only when the other three modalities leave property vulnerable. From the
point of view of the citizen, real-space code (such as locks) is needed when laws
and norms alone do not protect enough."

"They also invite a question
that has been asked by Justice Stephen Breyer and many others: Should law
protect some kinds of property—in particular, intellectual property—at all? 5"

"Among the kinds of property law might protect, my focus in this chapter
will be on the property protected by copyright. 6 Of all the different types of
property, this type is said to be the most vulnerable to the changes that cyber-
space will bring. Many believe that intellectual property cannot be protected
in cyberspace."

Footnote 6:
"There is a ferocious debate about whether these separate forms of regulations-copyright, patent, and trademark-should be referred to together as "Intellectual Property". I myself have gone both ways on this question, but currently believe it is harmful not to refer to these distinct bodies of law as "intellectual property." [...] by not calling them bythe same name, we lose a chance to point out inconsistencies in the way these different forms of property are treated. "

"Roughly put, copyright gives a copyright holder certain exclusive rights over
the work, including, most famously, the exclusive right to copy the work."
"The right is protected to the extent that laws (and norms) support it,"
"it is threatened to the extent that technology makes it easy to copy." (p.172)
"In this sense, copyright has always been at war with technology."
"as the cost of copying decreased, and the spread of technologies for
copying increased, the threat to the author’s control increased."

"The law responded
by giving composers a new, but limited, right to profit from recordings. When
radio began broadcasting music, the composers were held to be entitled to
compensation for the public performance of their work, but performers were
not compensated for the “performance” of their recordings."

"the single, defining feature of these norms can perhaps be summarized like
this: that a consumer could do with the copyrighted content that he legally
owned anything he wanted to do, without ever triggering the law of copyright."
"This norm was true almost by definition until 1909, since before then, the law
didn’t regulate “copies.” Any use the consumer made of copyrighted content
was therefore highly unlikely to trigger any of the exclusive rights of copyright.
After 1909, though the law technically regulated “copies,” the technologies to
make copies were broadly available."

"“mixed tape,” and some was simply for the purpose of avoiding the need to buy
the original recording. After many years of debate, Congress decided not to leg-
islate a ban on home taping." (p.173)

"Against the background of these gradual changes in the law, along with the
practical norm that, in the main, the law didn’t reach consumers, the changes of
digital technology were a considerable shock. First, from the perspective of tech-
nology, digital technologies, unlike their analog sister, enabled perfect copies of
an original work. The return from copying was therefore greater. Second, also
from the perspective of technology, the digital technology of the Internet enabled
content to be freely (and effectively anonymously) distributed across the Internet.
The availability of copies was therefore greater. Third, from the perspective of
norms, consumers who had internalized the norm that they could do with “their
content” whatever they wanted used these new digital tools to make “their con-
tent” available widely on the Internet."
"there was little the law could do to stop this
massive “sharing” of content. Thus fifth, and from the perspective of copyright
holders, digital technologies and the Internet were the perfect storm for their
business model: If they made money by controlling the distribution of “copies”
of copyrighted content, you could well understand why they viewed the Internet
as a grave threat.
Very quickly, and quite early on, the content industry responded to this
threat. Their first line of defense was a more aggressive regime of regulation."

"The initial response to this push was a White Paper produced by the Com-
merce Department in 1995. The paper outlined a series of modifications
aimed, it said, at restoring “balance” in intellectual property law."
"first part was a bust. 8 The report no more “restated” existing law than Soviet
historians “retold” stories of Stalin’s administration. The restatement had a
tilt, very definitely in the direction of increased intellectual property protec-
tion, but it pretended that its tilt was the natural lay of the land."

"In the terms of Chapter 7, these responses should be familiar.
The first response was traditional. The government proposed changes in
the law of copyright to “clarify” the rights that it was to protect. 9 These
changes were intended to better define the rights granted under intellectual
property law and to further support these rights with clarified (and possibly
greater) legal penalties for their violation.
The second response addressed norms, specifically copying norms. The
report recommended increased educational efforts, both in schools and
among the general public, about the nature of intellectual property and the
importance of protecting it. In the terms of Chapter 7, this is the use of law
to change norms so that norms will better support the protection of intellec-
tual property. It is an indirect regulation of behavior by direct regulation of
norms.
The third and fourth responses mixed technology and the market. The
report called for legal support—through financial subsidies and special legal
protection—of “copyright management schemes.” These “schemes” were sim-
ply technologies that would make it easier to control access to and use of
copyrighted material. We will explore these “schemes” at some length later in
this chapter, but I mention them now as another example of indirect regula-
tion—using the market to subsidize the development of a certain software
tool, and using law to regulate the properties of other software tools. Copy-
right management systems would be supported by government funding and
by the threat of criminal sanctions for anyone deploying software to crack
them. 10"

DMCA:
"Congress followed the recommendations of the 1995 White Paper in some
respects. The most important was the enactment of the Digital Millennium
Copyright Act in 1998. That statute implemented directly the recommendation
that “technological protection measures” be protected by law. Code that some-
one implements to control either access to or use of a copyrighted work got
special legal protection under the DMCA: Circumvention of that code, subject
to a few important exceptions, constituted a violation of the law."

Analog vs cyberspace:
"The White Paper proceeds as if the problem of pro-
tecting intellectual property in cyberspace was just like the problem of
protecting intellectual property in real space. It proceeds as if the four con-
straints would operate in the same proportions as in real space, as if nothing
fundamental had changed.
But something fundamental has changed: the role that code plays in the
protection of intellectual property. Code can, and increasingly will, displace
law as the primary defense of intellectual property in cyberspace. Private
fences, not public law." (p.175)

"We are not entering a time when copyright
is more threatened than it is in real space. We are instead entering a time
when copyright is more effectively protected than at any time since Guten-
berg. The power to regulate access to and use of copyrighted material is about
to be perfected. Whatever the mavens of the mid-1990s may have thought,
cyberspace is about to give holders of copyrighted property the biggest gift of
protection they have ever known."

"In such an age, the real question for law is not, how can law aid in that
protection? but rather, is the protection too great?"

"In what we can call the first generation of digital technologies, content
owners were unable to control who copied what." (p.176)

"Some people argued for
higher penalties for illegal copying of tapes (direct regulation by law). Some,
such as Richard Stallman, argued for a tax on blank tapes"
"Some argued for better education to stop illegal copies of tapes (indirect reg-
ulation of norms by law).But some argued for a change in the code of DAT
machines that would block unlimited perfect copying"
"The tax and code regulators won. In late 1992, as a compromise between
the technology and content industries, Congress passed the Audio Home
Recording Act." (p.177)
"The act first imposed a tax on both recorders and blank DAT
media, with the revenues to be used to compensate copyright holders for the
expected copyright infringement enabled by the technology. But more inter-
estingly, the Act required manufacturers of DAT technology to include a Serial
Copy Management System, which would limit the ability of DAT technology
to copy."

"As the Net is now, basic functions like copying and access
are crudely regulated in an all-or-nothing fashion. You generally have the
right to copy or not, to gain access or not."(p.178)

"As Stefik writes:
[T]he consumer does not have the option of
disregarding a digital contract by, for example, making unauthorized copies of
a work."

"An important point about copyright law is that, though designed in part
to protect authors, the control it was designed to create was never to be per-
fect." (p.179)
"As the Supreme Court noted, copyright “protection has never accorded
the copyright owner complete control over all possible uses of his work.” 18
Thus, the law grants only particular exclusive rights, and those rights are sub-
ject to important limitations, such as “fair use,” limited terms, and the first sale
doctrine."
"the law was never designed to simply do the author’s bidding. It had pub-
lic purposes as well as the author’s interest in mind." //cmp Copyright Directive

"Trusted systems provide authors with the same sort of protection.
Because authors can restrict unauthorized use of their material, they can
extract money in exchange for access. Trusted systems thus achieve what copy-
right law aims to, but they can achieve this protection without the law doing
the restricting."
"What copyright seeks to do using the threat of law and the push of norms,
trusted systems do through the code."
"The controls needed to reg-
ulate this access are built into the systems, and no users (except hackers) have
a choice about whether to obey them."
"Trusted systems in this sense are a privatized alternative to copyright law."
"the code is effectively doing the work that the law was
designed to do. It implements the law’s protection, through code, far more
effectively than the law did."

"Private law creates private rights to the extent that these private rights
serve some collective good. If a private right is harmful to a collective good,
then the state has no reason to create it." (p.180)

"The
state has an interest in defining rights to private property because private
property helps produce a general, and powerful, prosperity."(p.181)
"There is no property that does not have to yield at
some point to the interests of the state."

"This balance, the realists argued, is a feature of all property. But it is an
especially important feature of intellectual property. The balance of rights
with intellectual property differs from the balance with ordinary real or per-
sonal property. “Information,” as Boyle puts it, “is different.” 24"
"If you used my house while I did, I would have less
to use."
"If you “take” my idea, I still
have it. If I tell you an idea, you have not deprived me of it. 26
An unavoidable
feature of intellectual property is that its consumption, as the economists like
to put it, is “nonrivalrous.”"

"The other concept is whether my use of a divulged idea lessens your use
of the same idea." (p.182)

"If the law did not
protect authorship at all, there would be fewer authors." (p.183)
// cmp motivation Copyright Directive

"While we protect real and personal property to protect the owner from
harm and give the owner an incentive, we protect intellectual property to
ensure that we create a sufficient incentive to produce it. “Sufficient incentive,”
however, is something less than “perfect control.”"

"The Constitution does not allow Congress to grant authors and
inventors permanent exclusive rights to their writings and discoveries, [...]
It
does not give Congress the power to give them a perpetual “property” in their
writings and discoveries, only an exclusive right over them for a limited time."

"The Constitution’s protection for intellectual property then is fundamen-
tally different from its protection of ordinary property." (p.184)

"Economists have
long understood that granting property rights over information is dangerous
(to say the least). 33 This is not because of leftist leanings among economists;
it is because economists are consequentialists, and their objective in granting
any property right is simply to facilitate production. But there is no way to
know, in principle, whether increasing or decreasing the rights granted under
intellectual property law will lead to an increase in the production of intellec-
tual property. The reasons are complex, but the point is not: Increasing intel-
lectual property’s protection is not guaranteed to “promote the progress of
science and useful arts”—indeed, often doing so will stifle it."

"Taken together, these rules give the creator significant—but not perfect—
control over the use of what he produces. They give the public some access,
but not complete access. They are balanced differently from the balance the
law strikes for ordinary property—by design. They are constitutionally struc-
tured to help build an intellectual and cultural commons." (p.185)

"So copyright law strikes a balance between control and access. What about
that balance when code is the law? Should we expect that any of the limits will
remain? Should we expect code to mirror the limits that the law imposes?
Fair use? Limited term? Would private code build these “bugs” into its protec-
tions?" (p.185)
"The point should be obvious: When intellectual property is protected by
code, nothing requires that the same balance be struck. Nothing requires the
owner to grant the right of fair use."
"Thus, as privatized law, trusted systems regulate in the same domain that
copyright law regulates."

"As I mentioned above, the DMCA contains an anti-circumvention provision.
That part of the law forbids the circumvention of some technical protection
measures; it forbids the development of tools to circumvent technical protec-
tion as well. Most important, it forbids these circumventions regardless of
the purpose of the circumvention. Thus, if the underlying use you would
make of a copyrighted work—if you could get access to it—is a “fair use,” the
DMCA still makes it an offense to circumvent technical protections to get
access to it. Thus one part of the law of copyright grants “fair use,” while
another part of copyright removes at least some fair use liberty where the
fair use has been removed by technical means. 38" (p.186)

"Thus, when the law acts
with code to remove the law’s protection for fair use, this should raise an
important question—at least for those concerned about maintaining the bal-
ance that copyright law strikes.
But maybe this conflict is just temporary. Couldn’t the code be changed
to protect fair use?
The answer to that hopeful (and again, hopeful because my main point is
about whether incentives to protect fair use exist) question is no, not directly.
Fair use inherently requires a judgment about purpose, or intent. That judg-
ment is beyond the ken of even the best computers." (p.187)

". But contracts are not as bad as code. Contracts are a
form of law. If a term of a contract is inconsistent with a value of copyright
law, you can refuse to obey it and let the other side get a court to enforce it."

"As Stefik writes, trusted systems “differ
from an ordinary contract in critical ways.”
[I]n an ordinary contract, compliance is not automatic;"(p.188)

"The same is not true of code. Whatever problems there are when con-
tracts replace copyright law, the problems are worse when code displaces
copyright law."

"Code now makes possible increasingly perfect control over how
culture is spread."

"The balance struck by the law
was the best that authors could get. But now, code gives authors a better deal.
The question for legal policy is whether this better deal makes public sense."
"Here we confront the first latent ambiguity within the law of copyright."

Fair use:
"Were these transactions left free because it
was too costly to meter them? Or were these transactions left free because
keeping them free was an important public value tied to copyright?" (p.189)

"When new technology disturbs the balance, we must
decide whether the original intent was that there be a balance, or that the
scope of one side of each balance should faithfully track the index to which it
was originally tied."

"In the context of fair use, we
believe that either fair use is to be a minimum of public use, guaranteed
regardless of the technology, 52 or that it is just an efficient compromise in
response to an inefficient technology, to be removed as soon as efficiency can
be achieved."

"The loss of fair use is a consequence of the perfection of trusted systems.
Whether you consider it a problem or not depends on your view of the value
of fair use." (p.190)

Anonymity:
"We reveal to the world a certain class of data
about ourselves that we ordinarily expect the world not to use. What happens
when they use it?" (p.191)

right to read anonymously
"we must ask whether the latent right
to read anonymously, given to us before by imperfections in technologies,
should be a legally protected right." (p.191)
"It is a value that we can read anony-
mously, without fear that others will know or watch or change their behavior
based on what we read. This is an element of intellectual freedom; it is a part
of what makes us as we are. 56
But this element is potentially erased by trusted systems."

"This could first be a question of translation: namely, how should changes
in technology be accommodated to preserve values from an earlier context in
a new context?"

"She argues that there is a right to resist, or
“hack,” trusted systems to the extent that they infringe on traditional fair use.
(Others have called this the “Cohen Theorem.”)"

"Copyright law at its core regulates “copies.” In the analog world, there
were very few contexts in which one produced “copies.”" (p.192)

"As Jessica Litman
described more than a decade ago,
At the turn of the century, U.S. copyright law was technical, inconsistent, and
difficult to understand, but it didn’t apply to very many people or very many
things. If one were an author or publisher of books, maps, charts, paintings,
sculpture, photographs or sheet music, a playwright or producer of plays, or a
printer, the copyright law bore on one’s business. Booksellers, piano-roll and
phonograph record publishers, motion picture producers, musicians, scholars,
members of Congress, and ordinary consumers could go about their business
without ever encountering a copyright problem. 58"

"Thus there were many ways in which you could use creative work in the
analog world without producing a copy."
"Digital technology, at its core, makes copies."
"There is no way to use any content in a digital
context without that use producing a copy."

"While in the analog world, life was
sans copyright law; in the digital world, life is subject to copyright law." (p.193)
"The emergence of digital
technologies has thus radically increased the domain of copyright law—from
regulating a tiny portion of human life, to regulating absolutely every bit of
life on a computer."

"Now if all you think about is protecting the distribution of professionally
created culture, this might not concern you much. If you’re trying to stop
“piracy,” then a regime that says every use requires permission is a regime
that gives you a fairly broad range of tools for stamping out piracy."
"just now, in fact, protecting the distribution of profes-
sionally created culture is not the only, or even, I suggest, the most
important part of culture. And indeed, from a historical perspective, top-
down, professionally produced culture is but a tiny part of what makes
any culture sing."

"Standing alongside professional culture is amateur culture—where ama-
teur doesn’t mean inferior or without talent, but instead culture created by
people who produce not for the money, but for the love of what they do."

"Importantly, too, this kind of cultural remix has historically been free of
regulation." (p.194)

"All this has now changed, and digital technologies are responsible. First,
and most important, digital technologies have radically expanded the scope of
this amateur culture. Now the clever remix of some political event or the
latest song by your favorite band are not just something you can share with
your friends. Digital technologies have made it simple to capture and share
this creativity with the world."
"“Peo-
ple are waking from their consumerist coma,” one commentator describes. 62"

". To the extent it uses others’ creativity, it needs the per-
mission of others. To the extent it builds upon the creativity of others, it needs
to be sure that that creativity can be built upon legally. A whole system of reg-
ulation has now been grafted upon an economy of creativity that until now
has never known regulation. Amateur culture, or bottom up culture, or the
culture that lives outside of commercial transactions—all of this is subject to
regulation in a way that 30 years ago it was not." (p.195)

"while there is extensive and new
regulation of amateur culture, that regulation creates new wealth for profes-
sional culture. There’s a choice to be made about which form of culture we
should protect."
// EU Copyright Directive takes a clear stance on this one

"These three examples reveal a common pattern—one that will reach far
beyond copyright. At one time we enjoyed a certain kind of liberty. But that
liberty was not directly chosen; it was a liberty resulting from the high costs of
control. 65" (p.196)

"When costs of control fall, however, liberty is threatened."

Pending Choices:
- whether to allow intellectual property in effect to
become completely propertized
- whether to allow this regime to
erase the anonymity latent in less efficient architectures of control
- whether
to allow the expansion of intellectual property to drive out amateur culture

"However efficient the alternative may be, we should
certainly architect cyberspaces to ensure anonymity—or more precisely, pseu-
donymity—first." (p.197)
"All of the good that comes
from monitoring could be achieved while protecting privacy. It may take a bit
more coding to build in routines for breaking traceability"

"We can architect cyberspace to preserve a commons or not." (p.198)

"I still believe private action alone is not enough." (p.199)

Footnote 10:
"The most important such threat is the anticircumvention provision of the Digital
Millennium Copyright Act, which makes it a crime (subject to complex exceptions) to man-
ufacture code to circumvent a copyright protection mechanism, even if the use of the under-
lying material itself would be a fair use" (p.373)
