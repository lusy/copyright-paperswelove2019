<p>&quot;The European Council (EC) describes their key goals with the Directive as protecting press publications; reducing the &quot;value gap&quot; between the profits made by Internet platforms and by content creators; encouraging collaboration between these two groups, and creating copyright exceptions for text- and data-mining.&quot; Source: EN WP</p>

<h1>Chapter 10: Intellectual Property</h1>
</section>
<section class="slide level1">

<h2 id="in-a-nutshell">In a nutshell</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;We are not entering a time when copyright is more threatened than it is in real space. We are instead entering a time when copyright is more effectively protected than at any time since Gutenberg.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
</section>
<section id="copyright-historically" class="slide level1">
<h1>Copyright, historically</h1>
</section>
<section class="slide level1">

<p>&quot;the single, defining feature of these norms can perhaps be summarized like this: that a consumer could do with the copyrighted content that he legally owned anything he wanted to do, without ever triggering the law of copyright.&quot;</p>
</section>
<section class="slide level1">

<p>&quot;Roughly put, copyright gives a copyright holder certain exclusive rights over the work, including, most famously, the exclusive right to copy the work.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The right is protected to the extent that laws (and norms) support it,&quot; &quot;it is threatened to the extent that technology makes it easy to copy.&quot; &quot;In this sense, copyright has always been at war with technology.&quot;</p>
</section>
<section class="slide level1">

<h2 id="analog-vs-digital">Analog vs digital</h2>
<p>&quot;Thus there were many ways in which you could use creative work in the analog world without producing a copy.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Digital technology, at its core, makes copies.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;There is no way to use any content in a digital context without that use producing a copy.&quot;</p>
</section>
<section class="slide level1">

<h2 id="possible-regulators">Possible regulators</h2>
<p>&quot;What means would bring about the most efficient set of protections for property interests in cyberspace?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;One is the traditional protection of law—the law defines a space where others should not enter and punishes people who enter nonetheless. The other protection is a fence, a technological device (a bit of code) that (among other things) blocks the unwanted from entering.&quot;</p>
</section>
<section class="slide level1">

<p>&quot;it is hard for the law to distinguish between legitimate and illegitiamate uses of cyberspaces&quot;</p>
</section>
<section class="slide level1">

<h2 id="white-paper-1995">White Paper 1995</h2>
<p>&quot;The White Paper proceeds as if the problem of protecting intellectual property in cyberspace was just like the problem of protecting intellectual property in real space. [...] But something fundamental has changed: the role that code plays in the protection of intellectual property. Code can, and increasingly will, displace law as the primary defense of intellectual property in cyberspace. Private fences, not public law.&quot;</p>
</section>
<section class="slide level1">

<h2 id="dmca-1998">DMCA 1998</h2>
<p>&quot;Code that someone implements to control either access to or use of a copyrighted work got special legal protection under the DMCA: Circumvention of that code, subject to a few important exceptions, constituted a violation of the law.&quot;</p>
</section>
<section class="slide level1">

<h2 id="law-vs-contracts-vs-code">Law vs contracts vs code</h2>
<p>&quot;As Stefik writes: [T]he consumer does not have the option of disregarding a digital contract by, for example, making unauthorized copies of a work.&quot;</p>
</section>
<section class="slide level1">

<h2 id="for-whom-is-the-law">For whom is the law</h2>
<p>&quot;Private law creates private rights to the extent that these private rights serve some collective good. If a private right is harmful to a collective good, then the state has no reason to create it.&quot;</p>
</section>
<section class="slide level1">

<p>&quot;If the law did not protect authorship at all, there would be fewer authors.&quot;</p>
</section>
<section class="slide level1">

<p>&quot;Now if all you think about is protecting the distribution of professionally created culture, this might not concern you much. If you’re trying to stop “piracy,” then a regime that says every use requires permission is a regime that gives you a fairly broad range of tools for stamping out piracy.&quot;</p>
</section>
<section class="slide level1">

<p>&quot;Standing alongside professional culture is amateur culture—where amateur doesn’t mean inferior or without talent, but instead culture created by people who produce not for the money, but for the love of what they do.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Importantly, too, this kind of cultural remix has historically been free of regulation.&quot;</p>
</section>
<section class="slide level1">

<h2 id="fair-use">Fair use</h2>
<p>&quot;Were these transactions left free because it was too costly to meter them? Or were these transactions left free because keeping them free was an important public value tied to copyright?&quot;</p>
</section>
<section class="slide level1">

<p>&quot;But maybe this conflict is just temporary. Couldn’t the code be changed to protect fair use? The answer to that hopeful (and again, hopeful because my main point is about whether incentives to protect fair use exist) question is no, not directly. Fair use inherently requires a judgment about purpose, or intent. That judgment is beyond the ken of even the best computers.&quot;</p>
</section>
<section class="slide level1">

<h2 id="right-to-read-anonymously">right to read anonymously</h2>
<p>&quot;we must ask whether the latent right to read anonymously, given to us before by imperfections in technologies, should be a legally protected right.&quot;</p>
</section>
<section class="slide level1">

<p>&quot;These three examples reveal a common pattern—one that will reach far beyond copyright. At one time we enjoyed a certain kind of liberty. But that liberty was not directly chosen; it was a liberty resulting from the high costs of control.&quot;</p>
</section>
<section class="slide level1">

<h2 id="pending-choices">Pending Choices</h2>
<ul>
<li class="fragment">whether to allow intellectual property in effect to become completely propertized</li>
<li class="fragment">whether to allow this regime to erase the anonymity latent in less efficient architectures of control</li>
<li class="fragment">whether to allow the expansion of intellectual property to drive out amateur culture</li>
</ul>
