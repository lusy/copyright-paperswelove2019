<blockquote>
<p>&quot;We are not entering a time when copyright is more threatened than it is in real space. We are instead entering a time when copyright is more effectively protected than at any time since Gutenberg.&quot;</p>

<p>//Notes Cyberspace/the Internet changes not only the possibilities for content duplication and sharing but also the possibilities for control. Balance is displaced; fair use (previously tolerated because prosecution was unfeasible?) is threatened</p>

<section class="slide level1">

<p>&quot;As Jessica Litman described more than a decade ago, At the turn of the century, U.S. copyright law was technical, inconsistent, and difficult to understand, but it didn’t apply to very many people or very many things. If one were an author or publisher of books, maps, charts, paintings, sculpture, photographs or sheet music, a playwright or producer of plays, or a printer, the copyright law bore on one’s business. Booksellers, piano-roll and phonograph record publishers, motion picture producers, musicians, scholars, members of Congress, and ordinary consumers could go about their business without ever encountering a copyright problem. 58&quot;</p>
</section>
<section class="slide level1">

<p>&quot;Thus there were many ways in which you could use creative work in the analog world without producing a copy.&quot; &quot;Digital technology, at its core, makes copies.&quot; &quot;There is no way to use any content in a digital context without that use producing a copy.&quot;</p>
</section>
<section class="slide level1">

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;What means would bring about the most efficient set of protections for property interests in cyberspace?&quot; (p.169) &quot;One is the traditional protection of law—the law defines a space where others should not enter and punishes people who enter nonetheless. The other protection is a fence, a technological device (a bit of code) that (among other things) blocks the unwanted from entering.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Notes: &quot;costs of law in this context are extremely high&quot; &quot;costs of enforcement, but also because it is hard for the law to distinguish between legitimate and illegiti- mate uses of cyberspaces.&quot; &quot;Legitimacy depends on the intention of the person granting access.&quot; &quot;since the fences of cyberspace can be made to reflect that intent cheaply, it is best to put all the incentive on the owner to define access as he wishes. The right to browse should be the norm, and the burden to lock doors should be placed on the owner. 4&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Roughly put, copyright gives a copyright holder certain exclusive rights over the work, including, most famously, the exclusive right to copy the work.&quot; &quot;The right is protected to the extent that laws (and norms) support it,&quot; &quot;it is threatened to the extent that technology makes it easy to copy.&quot; (p.172) &quot;In this sense, copyright has always been at war with technology.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;the single, defining feature of these norms can perhaps be summarized like this: that a consumer could do with the copyrighted content that he legally owned anything he wanted to do, without ever triggering the law of copyright.&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The White Paper proceeds as if the problem of pro- tecting intellectual property in cyberspace was just like the problem of protecting intellectual property in real space. [...] But something fundamental has changed: the role that code plays in the protection of intellectual property. Code can, and increasingly will, displace law as the primary defense of intellectual property in cyberspace. Private fences, not public law.&quot; (p.175)</p>

<p>&quot;In such an age, the real question for law is not, how can law aid in that protection? but rather, is the protection too great?&quot; //<em>cough</em>, EU Directive</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;As Stefik writes: [T]he consumer does not have the option of disregarding a digital contract by, for example, making unauthorized copies of a work.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
</section>
<section class="slide level1">

<p>&quot;An important point about copyright law is that, though designed in part to protect authors, the control it was designed to create was never to be per- fect.&quot; (p.179) &quot;As the Supreme Court noted, copyright “protection has never accorded the copyright owner complete control over all possible uses of his work.” 18 Thus, the law grants only particular exclusive rights, and those rights are sub- ject to important limitations, such as “fair use,” limited terms, and the first sale doctrine.&quot; &quot;the law was never designed to simply do the author’s bidding. It had pub- lic purposes as well as the author’s interest in mind.&quot; //cmp Copyright Directive</p>
</section>
<section class="slide level1">

<p>&quot;What copyright seeks to do using the threat of law and the push of norms, trusted systems do through the code.&quot; &quot;The controls needed to reg- ulate this access are built into the systems, and no users (except hackers) have a choice about whether to obey them.&quot; &quot;Trusted systems in this sense are a privatized alternative to copyright law.&quot;</p>
</section>
<section class="slide level1">

<p>&quot;Private law creates private rights to the extent that these private rights serve some collective good. If a private right is harmful to a collective good, then the state has no reason to create it.&quot; (p.180)</p>
</section>
<section class="slide level1">

<p>&quot;If the law did not protect authorship at all, there would be fewer authors.&quot; (p.183) // cmp motivation Copyright Directive</p>
</section>
<section class="slide level1">

<p>&quot;Increasing intel- lectual property’s protection is not guaranteed to “promote the progress of science and useful arts”—indeed, often doing so will stifle it.&quot;</p>
</section>
<section class="slide level1">

<p>&quot;So copyright law strikes a balance between control and access. What about that balance when code is the law? Should we expect that any of the limits will remain? Should we expect code to mirror the limits that the law imposes? Fair use? Limited term? Would private code build these “bugs” into its protec- tions?&quot; (p.185) &quot;The point should be obvious: When intellectual property is protected by code, nothing requires that the same balance be struck. Nothing requires the owner to grant the right of fair use.&quot;</p>
</section>
<section class="slide level1">

<p>&quot;As I mentioned above, the DMCA contains an anti-circumvention provision. That part of the law forbids the circumvention of some technical protection measures; it forbids the development of tools to circumvent technical protec- tion as well. Most important, it forbids these circumventions regardless of the purpose of the circumvention. Thus, if the underlying use you would make of a copyrighted work—if you could get access to it—is a “fair use,” the DMCA still makes it an offense to circumvent technical protections to get access to it. Thus one part of the law of copyright grants “fair use,” while another part of copyright removes at least some fair use liberty where the fair use has been removed by technical means. 38&quot; (p.186)</p>
</section>
<section class="slide level1">

<p>But maybe this conflict is just temporary. Couldn’t the code be changed to protect fair use? The answer to that hopeful (and again, hopeful because my main point is about whether incentives to protect fair use exist) question is no, not directly. Fair use inherently requires a judgment about purpose, or intent. That judg- ment is beyond the ken of even the best computers.&quot; (p.187) //cmp article 13</p>
</section>
<section class="slide level1">

<p>&quot;As Stefik writes, trusted systems “differ from an ordinary contract in critical ways.” [I]n an ordinary contract, compliance is not automatic;&quot;(p.188)</p>
</section>
<section class="slide level1">

<p>&quot;The balance struck by the law was the best that authors could get. But now, code gives authors a better deal. The question for legal policy is whether this better deal makes public sense.&quot; &quot;Here we confront the first latent ambiguity within the law of copyright.&quot;</p>
</section>
<section class="slide level1">

<p>Fair use: &quot;Were these transactions left free because it was too costly to meter them? Or were these transactions left free because keeping them free was an important public value tied to copyright?&quot; (p.189)</p>
</section>
<section class="slide level1">

<p>right to read anonymously &quot;we must ask whether the latent right to read anonymously, given to us before by imperfections in technologies, should be a legally protected right.&quot; (p.191) right to read anonymously &quot;we must ask whether the latent right to read anonymously, given to us before by imperfections in technologies, should be a legally protected right.&quot; (p.191)</p>
</section>
<section class="slide level1">

<p>&quot;She argues that there is a right to resist, or “hack,” trusted systems to the extent that they infringe on traditional fair use. (Others have called this the “Cohen Theorem.”)&quot;</p>
</section>
<section class="slide level1">

<p>&quot;Now if all you think about is protecting the distribution of professionally created culture, this might not concern you much. If you’re trying to stop “piracy,” then a regime that says every use requires permission is a regime that gives you a fairly broad range of tools for stamping out piracy.&quot; &quot;just now, in fact, protecting the distribution of profes- sionally created culture is not the only, or even, I suggest, the most important part of culture. And indeed, from a historical perspective, top- down, professionally produced culture is but a tiny part of what makes any culture sing.&quot;</p>
</section>
<section class="slide level1">

<p>&quot;Standing alongside professional culture is amateur culture—where ama- teur doesn’t mean inferior or without talent, but instead culture created by people who produce not for the money, but for the love of what they do.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Importantly, too, this kind of cultural remix has historically been free of regulation.&quot; (p.194)</p>
</section>
<section class="slide level1">

<p>&quot;All this has now changed, and digital technologies are responsible. First, and most important, digital technologies have radically expanded the scope of this amateur culture. Now the clever remix of some political event or the latest song by your favorite band are not just something you can share with your friends. Digital technologies have made it simple to capture and share this creativity with the world.&quot; &quot;“Peo- ple are waking from their consumerist coma,” one commentator describes. 62&quot;</p>
</section>
<section class="slide level1">

<p>&quot;while there is extensive and new regulation of amateur culture, that regulation creates new wealth for profes- sional culture. There’s a choice to be made about which form of culture we should protect.&quot; // EU Copyright Directive takes a clear stance on this one</p>
</section>
<section class="slide level1">

<p>&quot;These three examples reveal a common pattern—one that will reach far beyond copyright. At one time we enjoyed a certain kind of liberty. But that liberty was not directly chosen; it was a liberty resulting from the high costs of control. 65&quot; (p.196)</p>
</section>
<section class="slide level1">

<p>Pending Choices: - whether to allow intellectual property in effect to become completely propertized - whether to allow this regime to erase the anonymity latent in less efficient architectures of control - whether to allow the expansion of intellectual property to drive out amateur culture</p>
